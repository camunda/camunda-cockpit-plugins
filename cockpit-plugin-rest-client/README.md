REST Client Plugin
=========================

This plugin adds a very simple REST client to the cockpit dashboard. It allows to issue REST requests to the engine without
having a REST client on the local machine. This is especially handy for POST requests (as every browser can easily issue GET requests).

The plugin can prepare typical requests like correlating a message or starting a process instance.

How to use it?
--------------

You can use `ant` to build and install the plugin to an existing Cockpit
inside an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you installed the plugin it should appear in
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
