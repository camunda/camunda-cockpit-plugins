Deployments
=========================

Search for deployments within a selected timeframe. The deployments can be deleted afterwards.

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-cockpit-plugin-7.1.3-SNAPSHOT](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.2.0-alpha6.


How to use it?
--------------

The plugin shows you always the number of all deployments in the engine. You can search for deployments
in a selected timeframe. Afterwards you can delete a single deployment. 

You can use `ant` to build and install the plugin to an existing Cockpit
inside an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you installed the plugin it should appear in
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).


Known Limitations
-----------------

After deleting a deployment, the list will not be refeshed. Hit 'Search Deployments' again to refresh the list.
