This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-cockpit-plugin-7.1.3](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.1.0-Final.


How to use it?
--------------

You can use `ant` to build and install the plugin to an existing Cockpit
inside an application server.
For that to work you need to copy the file `build.properties.example` to `build.properties`
and configure the path to your application server inside it.
Alternatively, you can also copy it to `${user.home}/.camunda/build.properties`
to have a central configuration that works with all projects generated by the
[Camunda BPM Maven Archetypes](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

Once you installed the plugin it should appear in
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).
